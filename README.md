# ShareBox - File & Note Sharing Web Application

ShareBox is a simple, clean, and modern web application that allows friends to upload PDF and DOCX files, write an accompanying note, search uploaded files by name, and download or delete shared documents.

Designed with a premium **glassmorphic dark-mode interface**, it features smooth gradients, micro-interactions, responsive sizing, and drag-and-drop uploads.

---

## Technical Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (Mongoose ORM)
- **File Storage:** Supabase Storage (Cloud-based file storage)
- **File Upload Middleware:** Multer (Memory storage)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5 (Semantic elements), CSS3 (Custom properties, HSL colors, Backdrop-filters), JavaScript (ES6+, Fetch API, Event loops, Debouncing)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (v20.0.0 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (comes packaged with Node.js)
- A **MongoDB database** (either running locally or a MongoDB Atlas cluster)
- A **Supabase account** (free tier available at supabase.com)

---

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Extract / Navigate to Workspace
Open your terminal in the root directory of the application:
```bash
cd c:/HP-BACKUP/dowloadable
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to download and install the required node modules:
```bash
npm install
```
This installs:
* `express` (routing engine)
* `mongoose` (database modeler)
* `multer` (multipart/form-data upload agent)
* `@supabase/supabase-js` (Supabase client SDK)
* `dotenv` (environment configuration reader)
* `nodemon` (development environment auto-reloader)

### 3. Environment Configuration
Copy the `.env.example` file to create your `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and configure your settings:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.example.mongodb.net/sharebox?retryWrites=true&w=majority
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
SUPABASE_BUCKET=sharebox-files
```

> **MongoDB:** If you want to run it on a local MongoDB installation instead of Atlas, use:  
> `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/sharebox`
>
> **Supabase:** Get your credentials from the Supabase Dashboard at supabase.com/dashboard

## Running the Application

### Development Mode (with Live Reloading)
To launch the server with `nodemon` (reloads the server automatically on code changes), run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Mode
To launch the server normally, run:
```bash
npm start
```

Once running, open your web browser and navigate to:
```text
http://localhost:5000
```

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Uploader Identity:** Users enter their name so friends know who shared the file.
2. **Strict File Filtering:** Only `.pdf` and `.docx` files are accepted (handled both client-side and server-side).
3. **File Size Protection:** Uploads are limited to `10 MB` to prevent server overload.
4. **File Type Badges:** Color-coded badges (`📕 PDF` and `📘 DOCX`) make scanning documents simple.
5. **Cloud Storage:** All files are stored in Supabase Storage, ensuring no data loss on server restart or redeployment.
6. **Smart API Refresh:** No periodic API polling. The frontend fetches the list of files when:
   - The page first loads.
   - An upload completes.
   - An item is deleted.
   - A search term changes (with 300ms debouncing to optimize API performance).
   - The sort selection changes.
7. **Sorting Controls:** Sort items dynamically by *Newest First*, *Oldest First*, or *File Name A-Z*.
8. **Deployment Ready:** Works seamlessly on Railway, Render, VPS hosting, and other cloud platforms.

## Deployment

This application is deployment-ready for:

- **Railway:** Connect your GitHub repository and add environment variables
- **Render:** Deploy as a web service with environment variables
- **VPS:** Deploy using PM2 or similar process managers

Since all files are stored in Supabase Storage, no uploaded data will be lost during deployments or server restarts.
